        </h2>
        
        <p class="lead mb-5">


          Hello All,
         I am Aditya Kumar Jha, a passionate engineering geek. Yesterday I figured out Toptal, my initial reaction was "again freelance ?" because I was not taking freelancing projects for the last three months. The problem I faced was a Covid 19 situation, clients were not able to pay my dues and I have to manage a full time job also. The problem with freelane in  it's very unregulated and unpredictable. We don't know when we are getting a lot of clients and when we are not getting any. Here Toptal is managing all these hurdles, that's why I applied here.

          <h3 class="mb-4 mt-5 skill">Internship</h3>
          <p class="lead mb-5">
            Now my story: I was not a confident developer until I got an internship. It was a regular 9-10 hours per day job, where somehow I cleared an interview but didn't know the tech. My first project there was "Canvas Factory " clone website, it's basically e-commerce. I started learning React and node.js, it took me one or two week. But I and my team of two interns failed to build that website, our company has to bear the loss.
            The second project was an SMS app for shopify, whenever any user places an order they should get an order confirmation/fulfillment sms, because shopify only provides mail confirmation. It took 4 months to build that mini application, but I learned how the web works, how http requests are made, I khow facebook/youtube/twitter was not magic, I know anyone can build an application, I learnt what the background process is like. And one more thing I have to face clients every next day there, so I boosted my confidence in dealing with clients. I'm thankful to Mojitolabs, who offered me an interview knowing that I was noob.
  </p>
          <h3 class="mb-4 mt-5 skill">First Job</h3>
          <p class="lead mb-5">
            This internship thrill was becoming regular, and I had a new spark to work outside of India, just to know how do they communicate and how can I master communicating with out of India people. I also heard about their work ethics and seriousness for the work. I got a job at Globatalent, It is a financial app, which let sports fans invest in the sportpersion, If sportpersion wins then fans also win. There I had a job of react native developer, how I got that job was kind of funny. I was applying to a react.js job, I almost applied to my feed, but by mistake I clicked on 1 react-native one, and I got a call from them to schedule an interview. Interview was tomorrow, and I know just introduction, not any syntax so far I haven't written any react native code, Now I had to master it, I took a course on udemy of 47 hours, out of which I completed about 14 hours before the first interview and completed the course just before technical interview, and luckily they like my attitude of learning, CTO told in an interview "You are underqualified for the role, but I'm sure you are gonna learn it, and I haven't seen this spark on any candidate.
          <br>
          And I got a chance to work with two ten years experienced developer, the taught me how to talk ina  meeting, how to code efficeently , how to be deceplined , how to approach a problem, most importantly I learnt react-native, not only learnt I mastered it there.
          we used react.js and tailwind css to build our website and used react native for an app. Ans also I got chance to play with server, with node.js and koa.js. 
          </p>

          <p class="lead mb-5">
          My performance and connection at my internship paid me off here also, most of the freelance client I got were provided my them, that's why I valuer realtionship a lot, I truely beleve in "network is networth" ideology.
