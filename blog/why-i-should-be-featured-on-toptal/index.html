        </h2>
        
        <p class="lead mb-5">


          Hello All,
          I am Aditya Kumar Jha, a passonate engineering geek. Yesterday I figured out Toptal, my initial reaction was "again freelance ?" because I was not taking freelancing projects from last three months. The problem I faced was a Covid 19 situation, client were not able to pay my dues and I have to manage full time job also. The problem with freelane in  it's very unregulated and unpredictable. We don't know when we are getting a lot of client and when we are not getting any. Here Toptal is managing all these hurdels, that's why I applied here.

          <br/>
          <br/>
          Now my story I was not a confident developer until I got an internship, It was a regular 9-10 hours per day job, where somehow I cleared an interview but don't know the tech. My first project there was "Canvas Factory " clone website, it's basically an e-commerce. I started learning React and node.js, it took me one or two week. But I and my team of two interns failed to build that website, our company has to bear the loss.
          The second project was SMS app for shopify, whenever any user placers an order they should get an order confirmation/fulfillment sms, because shopify only provides mail confirmation. It took 4 months to build that mini application, but I learned how web works, how http requests are made, I khow facebook/youtube/twitter was not a magic, I know anyone can build application, I learnt how the background process is like. And one thing more I have to face client every nerxt day there, so I boosted my confidence in dealing with client. I'm thankful to Mojitolabs, who offered me an interview knowing that I was noob.
