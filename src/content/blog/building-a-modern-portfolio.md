Building a modern portfolio website requires careful consideration of performance, user experience, and maintainability. In this post, I'll share my experience building this website using Astro, a modern static site generator that offers excellent performance out of the box.

## Why Astro?

Astro has become my go-to choice for static websites due to its unique approach to JavaScript - it ships zero JavaScript by default unless explicitly needed. This results in incredibly fast page loads and excellent performance scores.

## Key Features

1. **Zero JavaScript by Default**: Pages load incredibly fast with minimal JavaScript
2. **Content Collections**: Markdown-based content management with type safety
3. **View Transitions**: Smooth page transitions for a native app-like feel
4. **Excellent DX**: TypeScript support and great developer tooling

## Performance Optimizations

The site achieves perfect Lighthouse scores through several optimizations:
- Preloaded fonts with font-display: swap
- Optimized images with proper sizing and formats
- Minimal CSS with no unused styles
- Strategic use of preloading for critical resources

## Design Decisions

The design focuses on readability and minimalism while maintaining visual interest through:
- Subtle animations and transitions
- Strategic use of whitespace
- Typography-first approach
- Dark theme optimization

Building a portfolio is more than just showcasing work - it's about creating an experience that reflects your attention to detail and technical expertise.
